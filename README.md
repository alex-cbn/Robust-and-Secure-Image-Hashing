# Robust-and-Secure-Image-Hashing
This work is based on an article called Robust and Secure Image Hashing

scratchpad is for now the main script in disguise

in2n, n2in, in2p, p2in, n2p, p2n are rather useless, they are based on an guess

varargs is a test script used for testing variable arguments counts in Matlab

imgpolarcoord.m is an imported file that may contain the answer to all our problems

apply_low_pass and downsample_image are the only sane things going around 
doing some decent work; these are actually used in scratchpad and make for
useful modules
