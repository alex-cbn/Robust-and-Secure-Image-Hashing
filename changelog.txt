IMPORTANT please do check postprocess.m and gray_code.m
GRAY_CODE CONTAINS ONE IMPORTANT LINE THAT MUST BE UNCOMMENTED


preliminary testing suggests some chance for succes
The model is 90% ready aside from the hideous gray coding
and whatever comes after
Now the race is onto finding a ballance between quantization and the output

Therefore I suggest actually applying this to real images
(Maybe Lightroom can help us batch edit or even photoscape :D )

We must calibrate our parameters because we need to determine the point in
which 2 images can be deemed as similar or not

Calibration is also needed for quantization...

Another issue is key based randomization: while changing one char in password the second shcheme can deem 2 pictures identical even if the keys don't match
